VaultRunner lets Claude Code log into websites for you—securely, automatically, and without exposing your passwords to AI.

When Claude needs to authenticate, VaultRunner pulls credentials directly from your 1Password vault and fills them into the browser. Claude never sees your actual password. It just knows the login worked.


WHAT YOU CAN DO

Tell Claude to "log into AWS and check my EC2 instances" or "post this to my Twitter account"—and it just works. VaultRunner handles the authentication seamlessly:

- Log into cloud consoles (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Access SaaS tools (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk)
- Manage social accounts (Twitter/X, LinkedIn)
- Check financial dashboards and statements
- Automate any workflow that requires a login

No more copy-pasting passwords. No more switching to the browser to complete a login. No more interrupted automations when sessions expire.


AUTOMATIC MFA

VaultRunner handles two-factor authentication automatically:

- Reads TOTP codes from 1Password
- Retrieves SMS codes from macOS Messages
- Pulls verification codes from Gmail

When a site texts you a code, VaultRunner grabs it and enters it—without you lifting a finger.


MULTI-STEP LOGINS

Many sites split login across multiple pages. VaultRunner navigates through them automatically—entering your username, clicking Next, filling your password, handling 2FA—completing the entire flow so Claude can continue working.


YOUR CREDENTIALS STAY PRIVATE

This is the key part: your passwords never touch Claude.

The credential flow is completely local:
1Password → VaultRunner → Browser

Claude only receives confirmation: "Login successful, filled username and password." That's it. Your actual credentials bypass the AI entirely.


HOW IT WORKS

1. Claude asks VaultRunner to log into a site
2. VaultRunner queries 1Password for matching accounts (returns usernames only)
3. You approve which account to use
4. Credentials flow directly from 1Password to the browser form
5. Claude sees: { success: true }

Everything runs locally on your machine. No servers, no cloud, no external services that could be compromised.


BUILT ON 1PASSWORD

VaultRunner uses the official 1Password CLI for vault access. Your existing 1Password setup works out of the box—same biometric authentication, same security model, same vault you already trust.


GETS SMARTER OVER TIME

VaultRunner learns from every login. It remembers which account you prefer for each site, stores successful login patterns, and improves reliability automatically. The more you use it, the better it works.


FULLY OPEN SOURCE

Every line of code is on GitHub. Audit exactly how credentials are handled. We built VaultRunner for security-conscious developers who want to verify, not just trust.
